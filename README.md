It is tested to be installed and run on FirefoxOS (B2G) Emulator. Since
it is using Mouse Events and does not handle Touch Events I assume that
you might experience issues on some of the real world devices currently
available. Following discussion of the community this is quite normal
due to the active development and discussions how to map Touch onto its
own eventing and mapping it onto Mouse Events at the same time. Ongoing
discussion seems to be whether to increase compatibility towards Desktop
Firefox Browser behavior with typical input device mouse or other
widely accepted HTML driven embedded devices offering touchscreen as
typical input device in contrast.

Beware: Spoiler

Do not look too closely onto the next screenshot if you still plan to solve
the Euler Square puzzle of size 10x10 on your own from scratch.
