mobile device like Geeksphone Keon and Peak)

Euler Square puzzle is running.

It is tested to be installed and run on FirefoxOS (B2G) Emulator and
Geeksphone Keon. Since some devices handle Mouse Events and
Touch Events differently I assume that you might experience issues
on some of the other real world devices currently
available. Following discussion of the community this is quite normal
due to the active development and discussions how to map Touch onto its
own eventing and mapping it onto Mouse Events at the same time.

Beware: Spoiler

Do not look too closely onto the next screenshot if you still plan to solve
the Euler Square puzzle of size 10x10 on your own from scratch.
