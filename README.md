mobile device like Geeksphone Keon and Geeksphone Peak)

![Application as installed in FirefoxOS (B2G)](/doc/img/eulerb2g.png)

It has been tested to install and run on Firefox OS (B2G) Emulator,
Geeksphone Keon, and Geeksphone Peak mobile device.
Since some devices handle Mouse Events and Touch Events differently
I assume that you might experience issues on some of the other real
world devices currently available. Following discussion of the
community this is quite normal due to the active development and
discussion on how to map Touch onto its own eventing and mapping
it onto Mouse Events at the same time depending on specific device.
Latest Firefox OS Emulator now simulates Touch Events. Earlier
versions used mapped Mouse Events only. Code has been adapted to
run on both.

Beware: Spoiler

to solve the Euler Square puzzle on your own from scratch.
